:seedling: I'm a student currently interested in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**! :seedling: <br/>
:sparkling_heart: My goal is to explore and create **efficient** and **novel** solutions. Like Diffusion-LMs, joint embedding predictive architecture, etc. <br/>
:brain: I'm learning! ✩•̩̩͙*˚ｄ(≧𓎟≦)ｂ˚*•̩̩͙✩ <br/>
:revolving_hearts: I was born in South Korea and live in the United States of America.

### :cherry_blossom: Some Projects I'm Working on! :cherry_blossom:

Here are a few things I've been working on or find interesting:

*   [**moe-counter**](https://github.com/nuni-neomu-areumdawo/moe-counter) :ribbon:: A counter script for Windows... for *research* and... *counting*!
*   [**Online-IDE**](https://github.com/nuni-neomu-areumdawo/Online-IDE) :globe_with_meridians:: Write and run code right in your browser!
*   [**Canvas-Scraper**](https://github.com/nuni-neomu-areumdawo/Canvas-Scraper) :books:: A simple tool to help gather info from public Canvas courses for educational purposes.
*   [**(My Profile Config)**](https://github.com/nuni-neomu-areumdawo/nuni-neomu-areumdawo) :gear:: This!

*(I have some other projects going privately... usually things I haven't bothered to polish. If you're interested in helping some involve Diffusion-LMs, web-scraping, multi-modal ML, data-analysis and some more fun stuff!)*
